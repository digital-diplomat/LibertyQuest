You start out on the outskirts of what was once Washington D.C., since torn
apart by countless riots and the looting sprees that followed. You lead a group
of scouts down the streets, approaching the more populated (and heavily
protected) section of Salvador's own personal city.

A group of rioters approaches you and your team, and it appears they're looking
for a fight. The leader walks up to you and gets in your face.

<Gang Leader>
    "Hey thanks, we could use some guns. Hand 'em over and we'll make sure your
    death ain't TOO painful."

(1) "You'll have to take them from our cold, dead hands!"
(2) "You have no chance. Join our mission, though, and you can keep the spoils."
(3) (Signal to the team to make a quick escape.)
