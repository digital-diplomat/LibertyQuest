"Dude, look at our team. Look at these guns. You're about as much of a threat
as the mosquitoes this evening."

The gang leader looks at you and his gang, and realizes just how right you are.

<Gang Leader>
    "We have nothing to lose. If we can take even one of your miserable lives
    with us, we'll consider it a success."

<You>
    "There's no need for that. You join our team, and you can kill people who
    actually mean you harm. We're gonna take down Dan Salvador and could use
    some extra muscle. In exchange, you keep the gun and a spot near the top
    of the political ladder. Sound good?"

Your potential teammate ponders the possibility of more power than he's ever
dreamed of. Of course you likely won't fulfill those promises, but the gang
leader is too dense and too desperate to realize this.

<Gang Leader>
    "You have a deal."
