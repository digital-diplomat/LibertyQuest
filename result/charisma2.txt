You approach the car, very careful not to flash the Desert Eagle on your right
hip.

<You>
    "Good evening, ma'am. I noticed you were following us; is there something I
    can help you with?"

<Officer>
    "We've received reports of gang activity in the area. Wanted to make sure
    you and your buddies weren't involved in any of that."

<You>
    "No, not at all. In fact we're tourists who wanted to see the Grand Palace
    in person. I think we ended up in the wrong part of town."

<Officer>
    "What, you don't have GPS on your phone?"

<You>
    "I thought we could go without it. Makes the journey that much more
    'adventure-like,' you know?"

<Officer>
    "Well that was a mistake. I'll tell you how to get to the Grand Palace, then
    you need to get yourselves out of here before I take you in for questioning.
    This is no place for 'tourists.'"

The officer gives you the very info you need before continuing on her patrol.
Your team is somewhat relieved they didn't need to get involved.
