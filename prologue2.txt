Year 2035

Supreme Ruler Salvador is the sole monarch of the New Federation of America. The
people are starving and desolate, with all wealth and production going to
Salvador to distribute as he sees fit. Many feel betrayed by a man who used a
vulnerable system, vulnerable PEOPLE, as a means to shove his way to the top of
the ladder...and they are NOT happy.

A group of freedom fighters -- gun stockpilers, ex-military, and the vengeful --
have come together in a small resistance group. You are one of those fighters.
Your task is to infiltrate the White House Grand Palace, and:

a) defeat Salvador, or
b) force his surrender.

Good luck.
