Having taken care of the gang, your team continues through the wasteland until
you've reached the downtown streets of Salvadale (the dictator has no creativity
whatsoever). After your previous encounter, you've realized that concealing your
weapons would be a much better tactic, and from a distance it seems as though
you are simple street walkers.

Your team is unsure of where to go from here. The streets are not well- marked,
having been neglected by a Dept. of Transportation that no longer exists.
Nonetheless you know that wandering around enough will lead you to such a large
and gaudy structure.

One of Salvador's patrol cars has been creeping behind you for a while, and you
fear the officer may be tracking your movements. After taking a lap around a
block, it becomes clear that the car is suspiciously intent on following your
path. There's no one else on this particular street: just you, your team, and
whomever is in the patrol car. What do you do?

(1) Take aim at the car; Salvador's henchmen deserve no mercy.
(2) Approach the vehicle and ask what the deal is.
(3) Try to get the car off your tail.
