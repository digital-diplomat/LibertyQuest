You tell your team to follow your lead and stay silent. Working your way through
the halls, you see corridors that look more and more like the house of that one
president from back in 2016. As they appear more and more lavish, you know
you're getting closer.

You sneak effortlessly past countless guards and cameras.

You find your way to Salvador's quarters, a lavish and gaudy room replacing the
Oval Office with a personal bedroom. You wake the coward up with a Desert Eagle
to his head.

<You>
    "Come quietly or I shoot."

<Salvador>
    "...wha... OH GOD! Guards!!!"

Fortunately, your team is standing at the door, waiting. Any guards who approach
know exactly what's going on, and that any sudden moves mean death for their
glorious leader.

<You>
    "Your reign of selfishness and cowardice ends here. We're putting the US
    Constitution back in place. First thing in the morning, we're broadcasting a
    message to all Americans that they are free once more."

With nothing left that Salvador and his cronies can do, your team takes turns
sleeping through the night, keeping an eye on the world's second most powerful
man (next only to China's leader). In the morning, Salvador broadcasts his
surrender to the American people, and a new election is immediately called for
the 50th President of the United States.
