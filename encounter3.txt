The Grand Palace is just up ahead, and the area is swarming with armed guards.
You know there's little chance of success if you decide to go Rambo, so you
instead move nonchalantly around the perimeter, looking for a weak point in
surveillance. You hear a voice from behind you.

There appears to be an open spot near the west wing, but it requires a key card
to enter. The only people in possession of such key cards are the very cards
that you have tried so desperately to avoid.

What are you going to do about this?

(1) Kill a guard in cold blood and take the card.
(2) Make conversation with a guard while a team member steals the card.
(3) Try to sneak into the building by some other means.
