Year 2031

The United States is in a state of political turmoil. The Democratic Party now
pushes for a full communist state, where all business is owned and controlled by
the government. Meanwhile, the GOP has become nothing more than a neo-Nazi
propaganda factory, pushing an agenda of "white purity" through a distorted,
pseudo-religious lens. Of course, members of the two parties hate each other,
and it appears that America is on the brink of a second civil war.

As many Americans rally, often violently, for their primary color of choice,
many are sick of the volatile and toxic nature of the country. They want change,
and with the 2032 elections coming up, an independent from Ohio has promised an
end to the hate.

Many Americans indicate that Daniel Salvador will be their choice when they hit
the polls. Salvador was relatively unknown until he gained an online following,
arguing that the US Constitution is flawed and needs to be..."updated" for a
modern world. While in 2020 the idea of revising it would have been considered
insane, the chaos of the 2030s has seemingly left little other choice.

Despite his lack of political experience, polls indicate that Salvador will take
the presidency by a landslide.
